# Introduction

In general, machine learning problems can be assigned to one of two categories:

**Supervised Learning**: where we are given a training data set that contains the "correct" output for a set of known inputs. Supervised learning problems can be classified into *regression* and *classification* problems. In regression problems we are trying to predict results within a continuous space, while in classification problems the output space is discrete.

**Unsupervised Learning**: where there is no training data set, and structures or sets are identified amongst the data that's being analysed. Specifically, *clustering* algorithms try to group data points in a data set into subsets where the items are somewhat "linked", while *non-clustering* algorithms aim to isolate specific data structures in a data set.
